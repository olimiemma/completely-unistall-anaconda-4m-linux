Let's completely remove the existing Anaconda installation from your Linux Mint system and start fresh. Here are the steps to properly uninstall Anaconda:

1. First, remove the Anaconda directory:

   ```
   rm -rf ~/anaconda3
   ```

2. Remove Anaconda from your PATH. Edit your `.bashrc` file:

   ```
   nano ~/.bashrc
   ```

   Look for any lines related to Anaconda (like `export PATH="/home/legend/anaconda3/bin:$PATH"`) and remove them. Save and exit (Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter).

3. Remove any Anaconda-related hidden files and directories:

   ```
   rm -rf ~/.condarc ~/.conda ~/.continuum
   ```

4. Remove Anaconda from your `.bash_profile` or `.profile` if it's there:

   ```
   nano ~/.bash_profile
   ```
   
   And/or:
   
   ```
   nano ~/.profile
   ```

   Remove any Anaconda-related lines if present.

5. Clear the conda cache:

   ```
   rm -rf ~/.cache/conda
   ```

6. If you've installed anything with `pip` while using Anaconda, you might want to review and remove those packages:

   ```
   pip list
   ```

   Remove packages as needed with `pip uninstall package_name`.

7. Finally, reload your shell configuration:

   ```
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

8. Optionally, you can check if there are any remaining Anaconda files:

   ```
   find ~/ -name "*conda*"
   ```

   If this command returns any results, you may want to investigate and remove those files/directories if they're no longer needed.

After completing these steps, Anaconda should be completely removed from your system. You can verify this by trying to run conda:

```
conda --version
```

This should now return a "command not found" error, indicating that Anaconda has been successfully uninstalled.

Once you've completed these steps, you'll have a clean slate to reinstall Anaconda if you wish. Would you like instructions on how to proceed with a fresh installation?
